This is a programming exercise to create an Infrastructure in Terraform with the following instructions:

* 1 VPC in us-east-1 region. This should be flexible based on region. If no region is provided, this should be built in us-east-1.  

* 2 Subnets with high availability supported in 2 zones 

* 1 Route table not including the default one. Routes should not be routed using the local route.  

* Autoscaling group with a flexible cool down, deregistration delay, instance warm up. 

* 2 EC2 instances created from the autoscaling group 

* ALB to load-balance the app servers. Ensure the port is flexible based on the application.
